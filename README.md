## What is MCRPG
MCRPG is a minecraft gamemode which will consist of a skill based system. With the use of the CitizensAPI we will also be working with quests and a “Work for reward” system. Leaderboards, PVP, PVE and skilling will be the main deal within this gamemode. 
The gamemode will potentially be highly adaptive and customizable to the ideas and creations you want it to be.
